For the start of my extension, I extended the formal grammar to incorporate
MODES.

These modes consisted of:
- GHOST MODE (still move around the screen, with no line shown)
- FAST MODE (move around the screen faster, with red line)
- SLOW MODE (move around the screen slower, with green line)
- RAINBOW MODE (each line is a different colour from the previous, following rainbow pattern)


The new Formal Grammar:

<MAIN> ::= "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<INSTRCTLST> ::= <INSTRUCTION><INSTRCTLST> | "}" | "]"
<INSTRUCTION> ::= <FD> | <LT> | <RT> | <DO> | <SET> | <EXPLOSION> | <ACTIVATE> | <DEACTIVATE> | <TELEPORT> | <IF>
<FD> ::= "FD" <VARNUM>
<LT> ::= "LT" <VARNUM>
<RT> ::= "RT" <VARNUM>
<EXPLOSION> ::= "EXPLOSION"
<TELEPORT> ::= "TELEPORT"
<DO> ::= "DO" <VAR> "FROM" <VARNUM> "TO" "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<IF> ::= "IF" "(" <CONDITION> ")" "[" <INSTRCTLST> "]"
<CONDITION> ::= <MODE> "==" <BOOL> | <VAR> "==" <VARNUM>
<BOOL> ::= "TRUE" | "FALSE"
<ACTIVATE> ::= "ACTIVATE" <MODE>
<DEACTIVATE> ::= "DEACTIVATE" <MODE>
<MODE> ::= "GHOST" | "FAST" | "SLOW" | "RAINBOW"
<VARNUM> "{" <INSTRCTLST>
<VAR> ::= [A−Z]
<VARNUM> ::= number | <VAR>
<SET> ::= "SET" <VAR> ":=" <POLISH>
<POLISH> ::= <OP> <POLISH> | <VARNUM> <POLISH> | ";"
<OP> ::= "+" | "−" | "*" | "/"


Note, activating a mode when already in another mode, overwrites the
previous mode. It doesn't make sense for fast / slow to be activated at the same
time. Also if the user wants to slow down, doesn't make speed up after this
mode is deactivated.

Also incorporated:

Random jumps, i.e. jump to somewhere random without drawing = teleport. Also shows
homemade animation of appearing.

Explosion - explosion displayed on screen - rapidly growing circles of colour from
Origin x,y. Then partial reset around the explosion region.

Added conditionals too: if. For modes and variables. Functions include updating the
Current word if the condition in the IF is false, to the first instruction outside
Of the IF TRUE instructions.
