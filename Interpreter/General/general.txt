This folder contains the functions, and header file used both in the interpreter and extension that are common.
The tests for these functions are in specific.c. 

Other functions needed for interpretation are also shared by the interpreter and the extension, but since slight variations 
needed to be made in each case, they appear in their repsective directories.
